这是一个不完美的世界  

一项伟大的发明可以改变世界，但社会运转的粘性实在太强，《基地》里对未来的预测就是基于这种巨大的粘性。 

是否存在一种更为抽象的”发明“，如同在粘稠的汪洋大海中剥离出一条条丝线，牵引洋流的方向。 

个人所能掌握的知识总是有限，而最近一百年间文明的指数发展，各种成果如繁星满天，过去没有谁能才有机会完全涉猎。 

杂学是对世界的好奇，不满足的渴望，学习新的知识，了解未知的世界，感悟已有的学识。 

2023年，AI终于有了质变，学会了理解人类语言，开始融合不同语种，渗透各学科。 

杂学社也随之创立。 

摄影，计算机，互联网，读书，看电影，哲学，小说，设计，编程...... 是兴趣爱好，也是生存技能。 

有了ChatGPT以后，学科的门槛会降低，杂学社可以藉此变得更”杂“。 

This is an imperfect world. A great invention can change the world, but the stickiness of societal operations is incredibly strong. The predictions about the future in <Foundation> are based on this immense stickiness.

Is there a more abstract "invention" that can be likened to pulling threads from a viscous ocean, guiding the direction of ocean currents?

The knowledge an individual can grasp is always limited, and over the last hundred years, the exponential development of civilization has resulted in achievements that sparkle like stars in the sky. No one has had the chance to completely delve into every field.

Eclecticism embodies curiosity about the world, an insatiable thirst, learning new knowledge, understanding the unknown world, and grasping existing knowledge.

In 2023, AI finally underwent a qualitative change, learning to comprehend human language and beginning to integrate different languages and disciplines. The Eclectics Society was founded alongside this evolution.

Photography, computers, the internet, reading, watching movies, philosophy, novels, design, programming... These are not just hobbies but also survival skills.

With the advent of ChatGPT, the threshold for disciplines might decrease, allowing the Eclectics Society to become even more "eclectic."
